My custom config files

Installation
------------

Update the `gitconfig` file with your personal Git username and email address.

Run `bash pre-install` to install dependencies i.e git, curl, zsh, tmux and oh my zsh.

Execute `bash install` to create symlinks for the configuration files in your home directory. This links them to the repository, allowing for easy updates via `git pull`.
